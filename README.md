Unifying the analysis pypeline

On the one hand, I had always dreamt of creating a unified analysis pipeline for my PhD work: I wanted to do my experiment programming, pre-processing, and analyzing all in one programming language. Using the psychtoolbox and MATLAB for everything except for LMM analysis (which I did in R), I came pretty close to this. But as the psychtoolbox is not developed anymore, my endeavors in this direction stopped.

One the other hand, I am always dreaming about a cheap, open-source based lab: A 100$ eye-tracker and a 700$ EEG system (yes, those exist and from what I hear they perform reasonably well), as well as linux machines and an open source programming framework. Psychopy already exists, so I thought I would check whether I can program a standard eye-tracking and ERP/FRP analysis pipeline in python.
